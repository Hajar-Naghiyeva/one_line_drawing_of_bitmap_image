# Bitmap Image Processor

This project is a web-based application that allows users to process bitmap images with various effects such as grayscale conversion, reduced resolution grayscale, and one-line drawing. It also provides options to customize the line color, background color, and cell size for the one-line drawing effect.

## Features

- **Load Image**: Allows users to load a JPEG or PNG image from their local device.
- **Grayscale Conversion**: Converts the loaded image to grayscale.
- **Reduced Resolution Grayscale**: Applies a grayscale effect with reduced resolution.
- **One-Line Drawing**: Converts the image into a one-line drawing based on the specified settings.
- **Customization**: Users can customize the line color, background color, and cell size for the one-line drawing effect.
- **Download Processed Image**: Users can download the processed image as a PNG file.

## Usage

1. Open the HTML file in a web browser that supports HTML5 and JavaScript.
2. Use the "Select an image file" input to upload an image.
3. Click on the "Convert to Grayscale" button to convert the image to grayscale.
4. Click on the "Reduced Resolution Grayscale" button to apply the reduced resolution grayscale effect.
5. Adjust the line color, background color, and cell size using the inputs provided in the settings section.
6. Click on the "Process the image" button to create a one-line drawing of the image with the specified settings.
7. Click the "Download" button to save the processed image to your device.
